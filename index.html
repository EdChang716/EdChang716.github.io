            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
                
                I am currently pursuing a double major in <i>Psychology</i> and <i>Bioenvironmental Systems Engineering</i> at National Taiwan University, with an expected graduation in January 2025. My academic performance reflects a strong commitment to excellence, with a cumulative GPA of 3.86/4.00. Driven by my passion for 
                <u>Data Science and Artificial Intelligence</u>, I have independently completed numerous relevant courses, including machine learning, artificial neural network, and Natural Language Processing, reflecting my drive to explore diverse and impactful areas within these fields
                (see <a href="Resume.pdf" target="_blank"> <i>my resume</i></a> for details). 
                

                <br><br>What excites me most is taking data science out of the textbook and into the real world. Whether it’s decoding human connections in <u>Computational Neuro&Social Science</u> or untangling environmental puzzles in <u>Environmental Engineering</u>, I’ve loved the challenge of transforming raw data into meaningful insights. These interdisciplinary adventures have led to <u>two papers</u> currently under preparation for submission to academic journals
                (see <a href="#research"><i>Research</i></a> section).

                <br>Data tells stories, and my passion lies in uncovering them through <u>Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Natural Language Processing (NLP)</u>. Whether it’s decoding the nuances of human interactions through Text Mining or addressing environmental challenges with predictive analytics, I thrive on using data-driven approaches to transform raw numbers into meaningful insights. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and statistical models, I aim to uncover hidden patterns and deliver impactful solutions across diverse domains. These interests have driven my academic journey and guided my contributions to interdisciplinary research. 
                <br>During my undergraduate journey, I had the privilege of contributing to two dynamic research labs, each offering unique opportunities to deepen my expertise and tackle real-world problems.</p>

                            We utilized a novel approach to investigate the link between mental representations of friendships and well-being through the Anna Karenina principle. By employing representational analysis, we found strong evidence demonstrating that not only quality or quantity of friendships predict well-being, but also how individuals represent their relationships in their minds can determine their well-being. The paper is currently under preparation for submission to <i>Nature Communication</i>; therefore, further details cannot be disclosed at this time.

                            I presented a novel framework combining MICE-RF imputation and LSTM-ED models to predict Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and Ammonia Nitrogen (NH3-N) levels in the Dansuie River in Taipei. Leveraging over 20,000 hourly data points, our model significantly outperforms traditional LSTM and CNN-LSTM models, achieving up to 14.1% R² improvement for DO and 13.9% for NH3-N. It offers reliable multi-step forecasts and robust handling of missing data.

                                We utilize OpenAI's text embedding model to investigate whether text embeddings accurately reflect semantic similarity and how the simialarities could be affected by the lengths of the texts from a dataset comprising nearly 35 articiles across various domains.
                            <br>The results demonstrate that These embeddings successfully differentiate articles from various domains. However, longer articles demonstrated higher semantic similarity compared to shorter ones, even within the same domain. This project offers valuable insights for future researchers, emphasizing the need to account for article or conversational text length as a potential confounding factor in text similarity analysis using LLM methods.

            <p>I accomplished a project focused on integrating large language models and generative AI into the company’s design interface. I developed a web application that demonstrated how generative AI could rapidly generate high-quality ad copy and design templates tailored to customers needs. 
                Additionally, by collaborating with the R&D team to integrate these AI-driven features into the company’s software, we expect to enhance both efficiency and user experience.

                    <be>My journey with music began at a young age, fueled by an extraordinary passion that drove me to spend countless hours practicing piano. This dedication led me to win multiple gold and silver medals in international competitions, and for a time, I even dreamed of becoming a professional pianist.
                    <br><br>Though my academic pursuits eventually took center stage, my love for music never wavered. To channel this passion, I co-founded a pop-punk band, <u>DayBreak Crammers</u>, during college as a keyboardist, blending my classical training with a modern twist. Our band not only created original music but also performed in various venues, sharing our energy and creativity with audiences. Music remains an integral part of my life, reminding me of the joy of creating and connecting with others.

                        Playing in the band has been a creative outlet for me, allowing me to explore different musical styles and express myself through performance.

                    <br><br>My passion for basketball began at the age of ten, when I first encountered the NBA. Kobe Bryant quickly became my idol—not just for his graceful playing style, but for the resilience, determination, and relentless passion he embodied. These qualities resonated deeply with me, as they mirrored the dedication I poured into my music pursuits at the time. 
                    <br><br>This mindset carried over into other aspects of my life, especially academics. Whenever faced with challenges, I drew inspiration from Kobe's "Mamba Mentality," embracing every setback as an opportunity to grow stronger. 
                    <br><br>From July 2021 to June 2023, I had the honor of serving as the <ur>Captain of the Men's Basketball Team in the Department of BSE</ur> at NTU. Leading the team to two runner-up finishes in interdepartmental and national competitions was not just about strategy and skill; it was about fostering collaboration, resilience, and an unwavering belief in our collective potential. 
                    <br><br>Basketball has shaped me into a more disciplined, strategic, and collaborative individual, traits that continue to guide my journey both on and off the court.
